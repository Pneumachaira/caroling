A little application I made for going caroling with friends.
It's in Java! Made in Spring Tool Suite. Uses MySQL.

You add a song, pick whether it's secular or religious, and then you can add lyrics.
In terms of user experience, the autofocus when adding lyrics is nice.
You can just hit enter after every lyric.

Ah, you can also make playlists. It's very convenient.
Lyrics also alternate between a dark background and a light background, so it's easier on the eyes.
