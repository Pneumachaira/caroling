A little application I made for going caroling with friends.
It's in Java! Made in Spring Tool Suite. Uses MySQL for the database and JSP for the front end.

You add a song, pick whether it's secular or religious, and then you can add lyrics.
In terms of user experience, the autofocus when adding lyrics is nice.
You can just hit enter after every lyric.

Ah, you can also make playlists. It's very convenient.
Lyrics also alternate between a dark background and a light background, so it's easier on the eyes.

This project was deployed for a brief time and used by myself and friends to go caroling.
It was quite convenient to have a one-stop shop for standardized caroling lyrics. Saved a lot of headache.

As far as updates might go:
1. Editing lyrics. Currently, you have to delete and recreate lyrics if you want to edit them.
2. Creating a randomized playlist. Ideally, it would pick two secular songs and three religious.
3. A mass-input option. Currently, you type lyrics line by line. This could be expedited.
